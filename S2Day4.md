system security strength but there is always a weakest 
link Called HUMAN being! ”
- The purpose of social engineering is usually to secretly
install spyware, other malicious software or to trick 
persons into handing over passwords and/or other 
sensitive financial or personal information 
## Types of Social Engineering
Based on how we do the social engineering attack, it is classified 
into many kinds.

### Phishing 
- Phishing is tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or 
credit card numbers, by pretend to be someone one is not as a trustworthy source. 
- Phishing can be done through email, social media or malicious websites.
- Phishing works by sending messages that look like they are from a legitimate company
or website. 
- Phishing messages will usually contain a link that takes the user to a fake website that 
looks like the real thing. 
    - The user is then asked to enter personal information, such as their credit card number. 
    - This information is then used to steal the person’s identity or to make charges on their credit card.   
### Common types of phishing
1. Normal Phishing


    a. THis is an attach that tries to fool any victim.
2. Spear Phishing


    a. Is a an attack that is planned and made for some person with specific loving and mindset  


### Vishing
- Vishing is Combination of “VOICE” + “PHISHING”.
- It is a Phone scam designed to get you to share personal 
information.
- BY calling to the victim you will do some information gatherings.   
### Shoulder Surfing.
- Shoulder surfing is a physical technique used to obtain/get 
information by directly looking some ones computer 
screen/keypad.
- When we enter our password, we might say dont look at me that 
is shoulder surfing. 
### Dumpster Diving
- Is a technique for getting data is a dumpsters or recycle bins.
- Old companies work was with papers, so when they finish with these 
papers whey will through them to the dumpster/basket.
- If hacker got that dumpster, and if those papers have some secret 
informations, or company workers name with the Job they intended 
to do, it will make the attack wider  
### Pretexting
- Pretexting is an attack in which the attacker creates a
scenario to try and convince the victim to give up 
valuable information, such as a password.  
### Common pretexting attacks examples

1. Romance Scam

- A romance scam is a type of social engineering attack that manipulates feelings like love. 
- Typically, the elderly are victims of such scams. Hackers target them because of their vulnerability. 
- A scammer may pretend to be an online love interest in such a pretexting scam, taking weeks if not 
months to win the target’s confidence. Ultimately, 
- they may ask for a large loan for an emergency, plane ticket, or a gift.

2. Grandparent scam

- In the grandparent scam, a threat actor will take time to gather intelligence on their target and their 
relatives. 
- They may examine the target’s friends list on Facebook and look at the profiles commenting on public 
photos. 
- Finally, they will create a fake profile with stolen information and media and approach a grandparent 
while pretending to be their grandchild, asking for money.
- The pretext may be trouble at school, a car accident, or some other type of emergency. Usually, the 
grandparent is sworn into secrecy so the scam can be repeated later until the victim or their family 
catches on.  

3. Cryptocurrency scam 


- Hackers are tricking people interested in investing in cryptocurrency with pretexting scams by 
pretending to be wealthy and experienced investors. 
- After telling their targets tall tales of financial rewards, they convince them to “invest” in crypto 
with them. 
- Once the scammers receive the money, they disappear.

4. Whaling attack 

- Such hackers either pretend to be company leaders to target employees 
- or directly target high-level players(CEO) in an organization. 
- Here, they may gain secret information or a sizable financial payment by using the pretext of a 
business deal. 

5. Impersonation

- Impersonation attacks are similar to whaling attacks, but the impersonator will pretend to be a 
friend, colleague, or unmet contractor rather than a high-level executive to avoid drawing 
attention. 
- The hacker will use friendship as a pretext to gain access to company information, servers, and 
drop malware like ransomware or spyware. 
- Neither the company nor the employee will realize there’s been a breach until too late. 
## Prevention ways
- Employee Awareness
- Multi Step Verification
- Using Password Policy 
    - Using difficult passwords(not your name,
    - birthday,pet,what you love)
    - Changing policy
    - Using symbols,numbers
    - Avoid default passwords
- Avoid Clicking on links before checking.
- Don’t believe any one.
- (peoples may come with their account)  
## Social Media Hacking
- Social Medias are an online platforms That helps to connect and share 
moments and ideas.
- Social Medias are like Facebook,instagram,Telegram,Twitter,....
- SO…HOW DO WE HACK THEM?
- TO get the data from those high level social medias, we have to hack Directly 
the companies , but this is very difficult to happen. 
- WHY is it difficult? Because
    - Their Security is Hard to broke
    - Their System is Updated
    - Their Employees are Learnt
- So, to Hack those social media we need some vuln/weakest point, WHAT IS THE 
WEAKEST LINK?
    - HUMAN BEINGS(HOSTS) 
- Here, the vulnerability we got on those companies is The users/the host so here we can use the social engineering 
attacks.

### The Social Engineering Toolkit(setoolkit).
- This is a social engineering tool what 
helps to clone websites and more.
- It is pre-built on kali and parrot.
- To use:
    - type ‘sudo setoolkit’ on linux 
terminal
    - ‘exit’ to quit the setoolkit 
## Automations
- There are a lot of tools to do phishing.
- You can get them from github.
    - SocialPhish
    - Zphisher
    - …
- As you see you can have all of those 
social media hacked. But you may get 
some errors and confusions now 
because we haven’t seen about port 
forwarding.we will see in upcoming 
class
- The method we saw before WORKS 
only in LAN network. For WAN we will 
cover it in the future.  
## So…How do we hack other websites
Websites like telegram, they don't use username and password, they use phone 
number as login. So what do we do….
Here The think we hack is the SMS code. To get this we can't just clone telegram, we 
just need to use social engineering.
Some telegram hacking scenarios

    1. Create a telegram support account and chat with them like they got a security breach and ask them to send the code we sent to you.(worked on 3 peoples)

    2. Create a telegram bot based on what the user loves then, ask questions like for the registration you need phone number, then be quick and add the number to the telegram and when u are sure the sms is sent for them, ask them to send the registration code we sent then BOOM!(worked on 4 peoples) => check youtube tutorials to see how to make bots, i have 1 too
