# INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
 
## What is linux?
###  - Linux is a kernel.

###  what is kernel?
- Kernel is code/program that used to meet your software and hardware.And allocate some resources. ![alt wow](efa(38).jpg)


### History of Linux
- In 1969 a team led by by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritche created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 mini computer,which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it.
- BUT IT WASN'T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
- Then person called "LINUS TORVALDS" created the Linux kernel.And posted online to make it open-source.
- Richard Stallman announced the GNU linux project in 1983 and confounded the free software foundation in 1985.
- GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS,But it was just software replacement not full os{Examples:Bash,tar,emacs...}.
- so GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
- The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied,modified and redistributed
### what is shell?

- Users communicate with the kernel by the shell.
- The shell is a command line interpriter .It translates commands intered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
### Types of shell
- Based on their features there are money shells.
   - SH
   - BASH
   - ZSH 
   - FISH
   > They differ in colouring,piping,command        compilation,some kind of features.
 -  TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL "echo $SHELL" 

## What is OS-OPERATING SYSTEM?? 

- We have  said UNIX and  GNU/LINUX as OS but what is OS. OS is"operating system",which means the main software part of computer that helps to work on.
- It contains :
    - Kernel 
    - Software
    - Desktop environment 
    - File extensions 
    - window manager 

# Why Linux ?
- ## FAST 
  - no high space computer/device needed 
# Why Linux?
 - ## Most used
 
     -  47% of professional developers use Linux-based operating systems.
    - Linux powers 39.2% of websites whose OS is known. 
    - Linux  powers 85% of smartphones . (Hayden James )
    Linux,the third most popular desktop OS, has a market share of 2.09% 
    - The LINUX market size worldwide will reach $15.64 billion by 2027 .
    - The world's top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on linux 
    - 96.3% of the top one million web servers are running linux.
    - Today,there are over 600 active Linux distros. 
# Why Linux ?

- Most Hacking tools
# Why linux?
- Most secured!
## Linux distributions/distro
- Distro is modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different : 
   - LINUX KERNEL
   - PACKAGE (GNU)
   - PACKAGE MANAGER
  - DESKTOP UI
### So many destros...
- DEBIAN 
   - Kali linux 
   - Ubuntu
   - Parrot
- ARCH
     - Black-arch 
     - Garuda 
- FEDORA 
- RED-HAT
- GENTOO
- ANDROID
## WHICH IS BEST FOR HACKERS  

- Kali-linux
- Parrot Os 
- Garuda 
- Black-arch 
- . . . 



# KALI-LINUX 

- Kali Linux is Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.It is maintained  and founded by offensive security.
    - Desktop env:xfce
    - package manager:apt
    - shell:zsh
# PARROT OS 
- Parrot os is a linux disro based on Debian with a focus on security,privacy development.
     - Desktop env:xfce
    - package manager:apt
    - shell:bash

#  GARUDA 
- Garuda linux is a linux distrobution based on the Arch linux operating system.
    - Desktop env:KDE plasma
    - package manager:pacman
    - shell:fish
## Do windows have distros??
- Windows is not open-source so peoples won't use/edit it,so there wont't be other kind.
 -  It just give updates and adds some feature on it.
 ### SO...HOW can we use it?
 --- 
 A) Main OS / Main-boot 
 
 B) Dual-Boot/2 in1 


 C)Live-Boot

 D) Cloud terminals 

 E) Virtual machine 
- Computer have a technology called "VIRTUALIZATION".This is the method how it allocate our using memory to the virtual machines/VM's 
- This a method to use  **windows** and **Linux** together .
- softwares that gives you this ability :
   - hyber V
   - QEMU 
   - Virtual box-Oracle 
   -   VMware 
   - . . .

F) WSL v2/windows subsystem for Linux 

G) Termux-Android
