# Malware Threats
## What is Malware
- A Malware is a set of instructions(program) that run 
on your computer and make your system do 
something that an attacker wants it to do.
- The name Malware Come from
- Malicious => ተንኮለኛ(bad thing)
    - Software => set of instruction(program)
        - Mal - ware   
## What malwares do?

    1. Removing data/files
    
    2. Encrypting data/files
    
    3. Corrupting data/files
    
    4. Stealing Data/files
    
    5. Spying on user
    
    6. …
## Kinds of Malwares
Based on their propagation/infection and attack, there are many 
kinds of malwares.

    1. Trojan
    2. Worm
    3. Virus
    4. Ransomware
    5. Rootkit
    6. Adware
    7. ...   
## TROJAN!
- Trojan, is a type of malicious code or software that looks 
legitimate but can take control of your computer. A Trojan is 
designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some 
other harmful action on your data or network.
- They don’t replicate.
- The name Trojan came from the Greek mythology Trojan Horse.
- Trojans will looks normal or legit software and then BOOM!   
### Greek Mythology 
- There was war between 2 countries and the winning country, 
send gift to the losing country the gift was huge wood house. But 
inside it there were soldiers and the soldiers came out at night 
and evade the city.   
## Common types of Trojan

1. Backdoor Trojan
    a. This Trojan can create a “የጀርባ በር” on your computer. It lets an attacker access your computer and control it. Your data can be downloaded by a third party and stolen. Or more malware can be uploaded to your device.

2. Mailfinder Trojans
    a. This Trojan seeks to steal the email addresses you’ve accumulated on your device.

3. Remote Access Trojan
    a. This Trojan can give an attacker full control over your computer via a remote network connection. Its uses include stealing your information or spying on you.

4. Trojan banker
    a. This Trojan takes aim at your financial accounts. It’s designed to steal your account information for all the things you do online. That includes banking, credit card, and bill pay data.

5. …  
## Worm
- A computer worm can propagate or self-replicate from one 
computer to another without human activation after breaching a 
system. 
- Typically, a worm spreads across a network through your Internet 
or LAN (Local Area Network) connection.
- Damages files on the system and the system   
## Virus
- Virus is a program written to enter to your computer and damage/alter 
your files/data. 
- A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer. 
- Viruses can also replicate themselves. 
- A computer Virus is more dangerous than a computer worm as it makes 
changes or deletes your files while worms only replicates itself without 
making changes to your files/data.
## Common signs of virus infection
- Speed of System
- Pop-up windows
- Self-executing
- Account being log out
- Crashing of device
- Mass emails being sent from you
- Files and system settings are altered.  
## Common types of virus
There are several types of computer viruses that can infect devices.

1. Resident viruses


    a. Viruses propagate themselves by infecting applications on a host computer. A resident virus achieves this by infecting applications as they are opened by a user. A non-resident virus is capable of infecting executable files when programs are not running.
    
2. Multipartite Virus


    a. A multipartite virus uses multiple methods to infect and spread across computers. It will typically remain in the computer’s memory to infect the hard disk, then spread through and infect more drives by altering the content of applications. This results in performance lag and application memory running low. 
    
3. Browser hijacker
 

    a. A browser hijacker manually changes the settings of web browsers, such as replacing the homepage, editing the new tab page, and changing the default search engine. Technically, it is not a virus because it cannot infect Files
    
4. Network Viruses


    a. Network viruses are extremely dangerous because they can completely cripple entire computer networks. They are often difficult to discover, as the virus could be hidden within any computer on an infected network. These viruses can easily replicate and spread by using the internet to transfer to devices connected to the network.
    
5. File infector


    a. It overwrites files when they are opened and can quickly spread across systems and networks. It largely affects files with .exe or .com extensions.   
    
# Ransomware
- Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim’s information 
at ransom. 
- A user or organization’s critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access 
files, databases, or applications
- A ransom is then demanded to provide access.
- Ransomware is often designed to spread across a network and target database 
and file servers, and can thus quickly paralyze an entire organization.
>> Ransomware => RANSOM + SOFTWARE  
## Rootkit
- A rootkit is a malicious software bundle designed to give 
unauthorized access to a computer or other software. 
- Rootkits are hard to detect and can conceal their presence within 
an infected system. 
- Hackers use rootkit malware to remotely access your computer, 
manipulate it, and steal data.   
## Adware
- Adware, or advertising supported 
software, is software that displays 
unwanted advertisements on 
your computer.
- Adware programs will tend to serve 
you pop-up ads, can change your 
browser's homepage, add spyware 
and just bombard your device with 
advertisements.   
### How do they infect?
- USB drop attack ( infected removable drives )  
- Hackers drop them around your company and when you plug it, BOOM!  
- Spam emails
- Malicious Office macros
- Softwares/Applications from unsafe websites.
    - Torrent sites   
-  Using Cracked Softwares
-  Malicious Browser extensions
## How they are hidden/undetected
Hackers use different methods to pass some protections and infect that system.

1. Packers


    a. A packer is a program that compresses an executable to make it smaller. It wraps the compressed executable in the code necessary to decompress itself at runtime. Packing changes this the binary patterns and some hashes(day5) , so the AV may not detect the packed file.
    
2. Crypters/encoders


    a. A crypter is similar to a packer but adds additional obfuscation or encryption to the mix. Like a packer, its goal is to change the binary fingerprint of a file to avoid detection. In a nutshell, the crypter encrypts the original executable using an encryption algorithm — often something as simple as a XOR cipher with a unique key.

3. Polymorphic malware


    a. At the highest level, polymorphic malware is malware that repeatedly uses packing and crypting methods to change the way it looks.
4. Downloaders, Droppers, and Staged Loading


    a. Many kinds of malware use staging programs called droppers or downloaders to learn about a system before installing the real malware. Some of these droppers scope out a system first to avoid triggering security alerts when they download and install the real payload.
## Malware Prevention

1. Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software.

    a. Example: kaspersky,avg,smadav
    
2. Use secure authentication methods.

    a. 2-factor authentication
    
    b. Implement email security and spam protections
    
3. Keep software updated
4. Use the least-privilege model.
5. Monitor for suspicious activity
6. Educate your users  
## Malware in history
Lets see some malwares happened in hhistory

1. Morris Worm: Also known as the Internet worm, this was one of the 
first computer worms to spread via the Internet and earn notoriety in 
the media.

2. ILOVEYOU: The ILOVEYOU virus infected tens of millions of 
computers globally, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.

3. Stuxnet: Some experts believe this sophisticated worm was developed 
for years to launch a cyberattack.

4. WannaCry: is a ransomware which targeted computers running the 
Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting (locking) data and 
demanding ransom payments in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.  
## Python for Malware development
- As we saw malwares do so many things and we can develop that 
malware based on the algorithm, We need. 
- First we have to understand what our malware have to do.
- There are so many kinds of malware purpose
    - Delete files
    - Encrypt files
    - Corrupt files
    - ….   
### Malware #1 - File deleting malware
- The algorithm is simple
    - When it load the program will delete files
        - The file being deleted is based on our plan, but if the file needs root  access then we need to build the rootkit too.
- For simplicity, i will show you making a simple python program that will 
delete files in a folder which it is opened.
-iruss create a test folder and our virus.py file
- Also let’s create some random files for test.  
### Starter
- Open your Vscode.
- Import os package
- OS package is a module that helps us to interact and do some Terminal 
commands because as you know python is not like bash and cant run 
shell commands directly.
- example   
#### Coding 
- Make sure you run them in 
the right test folder.
And go to that folder on 
your terminal/powershell  
#### Result
- Look 1st there were folders and files 
then boom after running our virus those 
files are removed.
This is the main concept between some 
file viruses. 
### File Handling in python
- Files are names locations on disk to store related information.
- Files Used to Store Data in Storage Devices.
- When we want to read from or write to a file, 
    - we need to open it.
    - And also when we are done we will close it.
- In Python ,a File Operation takes place in the following order:
    - Open a File
    - Read or Write(perform operation)
    - Close the file 
- Python has a built-in function called open().
- Syntax:
    - with open(“fileName or filePath”,’x’) as var
- Modes:
    - write---------------------------------w
    - read---------------------------------r 
    - append---------------------------a 
    - Create----------------------------- x
    - text mode-------------------------t 
    - binary mode---------------------b
- Example:
    - with open(“fileName”,’w’) as var:
    - with open(“fileName”,’rt’) as var:-> rt ~ r --text mode is default 
### Write on files
- in order to write on file we have to open it in write, append, creation 
mode.
- Warning: Be sure when you use ‘w’ because it will overwrite the 
existing file. SO use Append ‘a’
- Syntax: 
    - var.write(“Hello world”)  
### Reading files
- To read files on python we have to open it by reading mode ’r’
- There are many methods for this. But, we can use the read 
- read() - >This read file up to the inputted size number.BUT if you don’t add the size 
it will read it until the end.
- readline() -> To read files only one line
- readlines() -> reads all file in 1 line
- Syntax:
    - var.read(5)
    - var.readline()
    - var.readlines()  
### Creating file
- You just need to add the x on 
the type.
- But be sure if the file exists 
there will be File exists 
error.
- To pass this use the 
following…  
### Checking existence. 
- To check if the file is created before:
- import os 
- if os.path.exists(“filename”):
    - print(“the file already exist!”)
- else:
    - print(“no file!”)  
### Malware #2 - File Ransomware
- Here we are going to do our own ransomware.
- So how do ransomware words…. Algorithm?
    - They scan the system files
    - They will encrypt them with some key
    - Done!
- We can do the decrypter to 
    - It accepts the key
    - Decrypt the system files
- For our example we just encrypt and decrypt of files in our test 
folder
- For this we can use Fernet module from cryptography package.  
## Malware Analysis
- Malware analysis is a process of analyzing malwares
- When a system is infected with malwares , Security testers will do 
analysis on that malware.
- But 1st then will hold the malware as sample it is called artifact
- Then They will do the analysis 
- There are 2 types of analysis


    a. Static Analysis: Analyzing the virus, by just seeing the byte codes and the meta datas.

    b. Dynamic Analysis: is a process of analyzing the virus by running the malware in Sandbox/virtual machine. Then understanding the malware behaviour
