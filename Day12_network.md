# Networking for Hackers!
## Introduction to Networking
- A network consists of two or more entities or objects 
sharing resources and information.
- A computer network consists of two or more 
computing devices connected to each other to share 
resources and information.
- The network becomes a powerful tool when 
computers communicate and share resources with 
other computers on the same network or entirely 
distinct networks.
- Computers on a network can 
act as a client or a server.
### Client
- A client is a 
computer that 
requests for 
resources.
### Server
- A server is a computer 
that controls and 
provides access to 
resources.
- But have higher 
RAM,CPU and 
STORAGE
## Need of Networks
- Enhance communication.
- Share resources.
- Facilitate centralized management
- Internet
## Classification of Networks
    1. Classification by network geography.
    2. Classification by component roles.
## Classification by Network Geography 
- Networks are frequently classified according to 
the geographical boundaries spanned by the 
network itself.
- LAN, WAN, and MAN are the basic types of 
classification, of which LAN and WAN are 
frequently used
- Local area network (LAN)
    - A LAN covers a relatively small 
area such as a classroom, 
school, or a single building.
    - LANs are inexpensive to install 
and also provide higher 
speeds.
- Metropolitan area network (MAN)
    - A MAN spans the distance of a 
typical metropolitan city.
    - The cost of installation and 
operation is higher.
    - MANs use high-speed 
connections such as fiber 
optics to achieve higher 
speeds
- Wide area network (WAN)
    - WANs span a larger area 
than a single city.
    - These use long distance 
telecommunication 
networks for connection, 
thereby increasing the cost.
    - The Internet is a good
example of a WAN.
## Classification by Component Roles
- Networks can also be classified according to 
the roles that the networked computers play 
in the network’s operation.
- Peer-to-peer, server-based, and client-based 
are the types of roles into which networks 
are classified.
## Peer-to-peer
- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal.
- Each computer controls its own information and is capable of 
functioning as either a client or a server depending upon the 
requirement.
- Peer-to-peer networks are inexpensive and easy to install.
- They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
- Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking 
capability.
- The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer 
network is ten.
- Each peer shares resources and allows others open access to them.
## Server based
- A server-based network offers centralized control 
and is designed for secure operations.
- In a server-based network, a dedicated server 
controls the network.
- A dedicated server is one that services the network 
by storing data, applications, resources, and also 
provides access to resources required by the client.
## Client-based
- Client-based network servers process requests from 
clients and return just the results.
- These networks take advantage of the powerful 
processing capabilities of both the client and the 
server.
- Application servers and communications servers are 
examples of client-based networks.
## IP /Internet Protocol/ address 
- IP (Internet Protocol) is a 
Network Layer Protocol.
- A way to identify 
machines on a network
- A unique identifier
### USAGE of IP’s
- Used to connect to another computer 
or network.
- Allows transfers of files and e-mail
## IP types
- Based On IP versions
    - IPv4
    - IPv6
## IPv4 ( Internet protocol version 4)
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s.
- To make the IP address easier to use, the address is 
usually written as four decimal numbers separated by 
periods. 
- This way of writing the address is called the dotted 
decimal format.
- IP generated by DHCP or Manually
## IP structure
- IP addresses consist of four sections
- Each section is 8 bits long
- Each section can range from 0 to 255
- 192.168.1.1 is called GATEWAY 
ADDRESS.
- When you connect to some network an IP address will be 
generated and given.
- Every IP address has two parts: 
    - Network: to identify the network( የእናንተ,የጎረቤት)
    - Host: identify the user(ስልክ,PC)
## Private and Public IP addresses.
- Any HOST have 2 different IP’s
- Public IP:
    - is an ip address that is given to the host on the 
WAN network
- Private IP:
    - is ip that is given to the host on LAN network.

## There are 5 classes of private IP address A B C D 
and E
    ➔ CLASS A: Governments

    ➔ CLASS B: medium Companies
    
    ➔  CLASS C: small Companies
    
    ➔ CLASS D: MultiCasting
    
    ➔ CLASS E: Future Use (IETF research)
    
    
### CLASS A
- Have 24bit of space for HOSTS
### CLASS B
- Have 16bit of space for HOSTS
### CLASS C
- Have 8bit of space for HOSTS and 24-bit of Network
- It is Used on Our Home,school and Office Network.
- As we saw the host changes on the last 8 bit only so devices in same 
network have same starting numbers.
## Reserved IP Addresses
- Certain host addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to 
devices on a network. 
- Addresses beginning 127 are reserved for loopback and internal 
testing
- An IP address that has binary 0s in all host bit positions is reserved for 
the network address. 
- An IP address that has binary 1 or 255s in all host bit positions is 
reserved for the broadcast address


## Examples of Reserved addresses
- 0.0.0.0
- 127.0.0.0
- 128.0.0.0
- 191.255.0.0
- 192.0.0.0
- 223.255.255.0
### IPv6 ( Internet Protocol Version 6)
- IPv6 is a 128-bit alphanumeric long value that 
identifies an endpoint devices in IPv6 network.
- Format of an IPv6 address:
    - FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C
        - ALPHANumeric
        - Separated by colon(:)
        - IP generated automatically.
- The main difference is the IP-space(host holding) 
IPv4 holds 32-bit ip address but IPv6 holds 128-bit 
ip Addresses.
## MAC(Media Access Control) Address
- It is Given by A manufacturer of that 
network adapter.
- Network adapter is a hardware device 
that helps us to have connection ( our 
wifi adapter or our internet port)
- It is Alphanumeric, with 2 part
    - Organizational Unique Id
    - Network Interference control(NIC)
## MAC(Media Access Control) Address
- Flat name space of 48 bits
    - Typically written in six octets in hex
    - E.g., 00-15-C5-49-04-A9 for my Ethernet
- Organizationally unique identifier
    - Assigned by IEEE Registration Authority
    - Determines the first 24 bits of the address
    - E.g., 00-15-C5 corresponds to “Dell Inc”
- Remainder of the MAC address
    - Allocated by the manufacturer
    - E.g., 49-04-A9 for my Ethernet card

## TCP and UDP
What Is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)?
- Reliable
- Connection-Oriented protocol
    - Means it establishes a connection between the receiver 
and sender. 
        - It uses 3 way HandShake ( more on Network Hacking )
- Used on emails, Chat,watching online videos, simple 
browsing.
## What is UDP(User Datagram Protocol)?
- Connectionless
- less reliable, but faster and more straightforward.
- It’s often used in situations where higher speeds 
are crucial, like in streaming or gaming.
## TCP/IP model
- It is A reference model like the OSI model
- TCP/IP is the new and most used Model 
at this time.
- This model have 5 Layers
- Application,Presentation 
and session layers are 
combined together and 
called APPLICATION
## Firewall
- A firewall is a network security device that monitors 
incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides 
whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a 
defined set of security rules.
- It is Just A collection of rules to allow and deny network 
traffics
- Ex: You can’t directly access some host directly from other 
Network.
## Repeater
- Helps To 
boost/amplify 
the speed of the 
internet, in long 
route 
## Bridge
- Used to Connect different LANs
